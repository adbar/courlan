## How to contribute

If you value this software or depend on it for your product,
consider sponsoring it and contributing to its codebase.
Your support will help ensure the sustainability and growth of the project.

There are many ways to contribute:

  * Sponsor the project: Show your appreciation [on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/adbar) or [ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/adbarbaresi).
  * Find bugs and submit bug reports: Help making Courlan an even more robust tool.
  * Write code: Fix bugs or add new features by writing [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) with a list of what you have done.


## Testing and evaluating the code

Here is how you can run the tests and code quality checks. Pull requests will only be accepted if the changes are tested and if they there are no errors.

1. Install the necessary packages with `pip install courlan[dev]`
2. Run the tests and code quality tools:
   - Tests with `pytest`
   - Type checking with `mypy` on the directory: `mypy courlan/`
   - Code formatting with `black` on the directory as well
